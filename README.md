> Download

To get **Off Season**, download `OffSeason.zip` from the root directory of this repository. To play, open the zip file with any GameBoy emulator.

> PC

I would recommend using **VisualBoyAdvance**. If you do not have **VisualBoyAdvance** installed, you can download `VisualBoyAdvance-1.8.0-beta3.zip` from this repository or online at http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/gba/vboyadvance.html. 

For more information about setting up the emulator, [click here](http://www.fantasyanime.com/emuhelp/emuhelp_vba.htm).

> Mac

I strongly recommend using **OpenEmu**. You can find it at [openemu.org](http://openemu.org/). Simply open the game zip file to import it into the emulator.
